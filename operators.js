// An operator is unary if it has a single operand. For example, the unary negation - reverses the sign of a number:
let x = 1;

x = -x;
alert( x ); // -1, unary negation was applied

let a = 1, b = 3;
alert( b - a ); // 2, binary minus subtracts values

// Note that if any of the operands is a string, then the other one is converted to a string too.
